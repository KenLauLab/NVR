# **NVR (neighborhood variance ratio)**

Python implementation of NVR (neighborhood variance ratio) gene selection to select genes with local and monotonic variation [(Welch et al., 2016)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27215581). The selected genes possess specific expression patterns over the entire data space amenable to trajectory analysis.
